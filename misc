spinnakar =======================================
Yes! Spinnaker and Jenkins often complement each other:
Jenkins can handle builds and testing phases.
Spinnaker can take over for deployment and post-deployment processes.



STORAGE (RAID) ==================================

RAID : Redundant array of independent disks

Type of RAID :
--------------
RAID 0 (aka Striping).............. : Array of 2 disks. Data spread/strip accross 2 disks. no fault tolerence, any 1 disk become faulty, the whole data will be corrupt. read will be faster/speed
RAID 1 (aka mirroring/duplexing)... : Array of 2 or more disks. data duplicates on both/all disks. only 50% of storage will be used, provide fault tolerence and speed. 
RAID 5 (stripping with parity)..... : Most common - Array of min. 3 disks. data spread/stripped accross all disks (same like RAID 0), but with a PARITY bit. incase of any disk failure, the PARITY helps in rebuilding the data. 75% of capacity can be used. 
RAID 10 (RAID 0 + RAID 1) (aka ) .. : Array of min. 4 disks. combine stripping with mirriroing. 50% of capacity can be used.




SPLUNK =============================================
Forwarder
  - universal forwarder (lightweight 100+)
  - Heavy forwarder (ability to filter the raw data and then send to indexer)
Indexer 
  - Store and Index the raw data sent by forwarder
Searh-Head
  - ability to search the data with GUI



JENKINS ============================================
jenkins jobs
build jennkins job with parameter
schedule jenkins job (build trigger)
interact with GITHUB (github pluggin needs to install) 
/var/lib/jenkins <--- jenkins related files 
/var/lib/jenkins/workspace <--- all created jobs exists here
Jenkins notify --> email notification
run tasks/jobs on remote servers
jenkins + ansible
ENV variables in jenkins (Pre-defined --- example - BUILD_NUMBER, WORKSPACE etc.)
  Can  be created as well.
jenkins + MAVEN
Jenkins project type
  - free-style
  - pipeline
